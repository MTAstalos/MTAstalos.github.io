                    <h3>The Young Developer</h3>
                    <p>I graduated in May 2020 from Florida Gulf Coast University with a bachelor’s degree in computer information science. Upon graduation I was very excited to see what opportunities lie ahead of me. I soon realized quickly that I would need more than just a degree to be successful in my career. I needed to get experience and landed my first job as a programmer in Geographic Solutions. 
                       I really enjoy the company and because of the pandemic I’ve been working full time remote for more than a year now. Upon my year evaluation with the company I tried to apply for an internal web developer position. After not receiving any feedback for a months I took it upon myself to increase my skill set. I started attending UCF’s coding boot camp through this course plan to become a developer sometime in 2022.
